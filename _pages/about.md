I'm a PhD candidate from [School of Economics](https://econ.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research interests include public economics, optimal taxation and firm dynamics.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Xiaoyong Cui from School of Economics, Peking University.

You can find my CV here.
